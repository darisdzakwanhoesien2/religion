Task:
Produce a structured thematic summary of Surah {SURAH_NAME} ({SURAH_NUMBER}), covering its ayahs from 1 to {TOTAL_AYAH}.

Use EN DASH (–) for verse ranges.
Do NOT skip verse numbers unless the surah genuinely shifts topics.
Merge verses into coherent thematic ranges where appropriate.
Do NOT add introductions, conclusions, headings, or explanations outside the bullets.
