      "summary": "The surah opens with an oath by the **Wise Quran**, affirming that the Prophet is a messenger sent on a straight path to warn a people whose ancestors were heedless. It describes the spiritual state of disbelievers as being confined by shackles and barriers, rendering them unable to see the truth or accept the message. Allah emphasizes His power to **revive the dead** and His comprehensive recording of all human deeds and their traces in a Clear Record."

      "summary": "A parable details the mission of three messengers sent to a community who rejected them as mere **humans** and threatened them with stoning. A man from the outskirts of the city intervenes to support the messengers and is subsequently admitted into **Paradise**, while the community is destroyed by a single **Cry**. This range highlights the historical pattern of **prophetic ridicule** and the inevitable destruction of those who ignore divine warnings."

      "summary": "Allah presents evidence of His creative power through the revival of **dead land** and the provision of gardens, springs, and diverse fruits for human sustenance. Celestial phenomena, including the alternation of night and day and the precise **orbits** of the sun and moon, are cited as signs of the Almighty's design. The narrative mentions the mercy of carrying human offspring in the **laden Ark**, illustrating divine protection over humanity."

      "theme": "Denial and the Resurrection",
      "summary": "The text critiques the aversion of disbelievers to divine signs and their refusal to give **charity** from the provisions Allah has granted them. It addresses their skepticism regarding the timing of the **Hour**, warning that a single blast will seize them while they are still feuding. Upon the sounding of the **Trumpet**, humanity will emerge from their tombs to face their Lord for a final reckoning where every soul is recompensed with absolute **justice**."

      "theme": "Recompense and the Testimony of Limbs",
      "summary": "The inhabitants of **Paradise** are depicted as enjoying eternal bliss and shade with their spouses, receiving a greeting of \"Peace\" from their Lord. In contrast, **criminals** are separated and rebuked for following **Satan**, their sworn enemy, despite the covenant made with the Children of Adam. On this Day, human mouths are sealed, and their **hands and feet** testify to the deeds they committed during their worldly lives."

      "theme": "Prophethood and the Power of Creation",
      "summary": "The Quran is distinguished from **poetry**, being defined as a reminder and a clear scripture to warn the living. Allah reminds humanity of His favor in subduing **livestock** for their use and challenges those who doubt the **resurrection** of decayed bones. The surah concludes by asserting that the One who created the heavens and earth can easily repeat creation, as His command is simply to say \"**Be**\" to any matter."
