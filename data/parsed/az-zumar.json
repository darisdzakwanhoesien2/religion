      "summary": "Allah created humanity from a single soul and formed them in the womb through successive stages in **triple darkness**.

      "theme": "Omniscience and Intercession",
      "summary": "Allah holds sovereignty over all things, taking souls at death and retaining those for which death is decreed during sleep.
