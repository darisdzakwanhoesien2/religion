      "theme": "Recompense of Belief and Disbelief",
      "summary": "Allah nullifies the works of those who disbelieve and repel others from His path, while remitting the sins of those who believe in the truth sent to Muhammad. This distinction arises because disbelievers follow **falsehood** and believers follow the **truth** from their Lord."

      "theme": "Ordinances of War and Martyrdom",
      "summary": "Believers are commanded to strike the necks of disbelievers during battle and bind captives until war concludes, either by **grace** or **ransom**. Those killed in the way of Allah will have their deeds preserved and will be admitted into the **Paradise** He has identified for them."

      "theme": "Divine Support and Historical Lessons",
      "summary": "Allah promises to support and strengthen the foothold of those who believe and support His cause, while condemning disbelievers to **perdition** for hating His revelations. Reflection on the destruction of previous powerful nations serves as a warning that disbelievers have no **master**, whereas Allah is the Master of the believers."

      "theme": "Parables of the Final Abode",
      "summary": "The text contrasts the dwelling of disbelievers, who eat like cattle and inhabit the Fire, with the **Garden** promised to the righteous, containing rivers of pure water, milk, wine, and honey. Residents of Paradise receive **forgiveness** and diverse fruits, unlike those in the Fire who are consumed by boiling water."

      "theme": "Hypocrisy and Divine Oneness",
      "summary": "Some listen to the Prophet only to mock him afterward, identifying them as those whose hearts Allah has sealed due to their **desires**. The text emphasizes that the tokens of the **Hour** have already arrived and calls for the realization of **Tawhid** (Divine Oneness) and seeking forgiveness for the believing community."

    {
      "start_ayah": 20,
      "end_ayah": 28,
      "theme": "Trials of the Sick Heart",
      "summary": "Those with **sickness in their hearts** react with terror to revelations regarding fighting, yet true obedience would have been better for them. Allah curses those who make mischief or sever family ties, and He nullifies the works of those who pursued what **displeases** Him."

      "start_ayah": 29,
      "end_ayah": 34,
      "theme": "Testing Resolve and Forgiveness",
      "summary": "Allah warns that He will expose the malice of the hypocrites and tests the community to distinguish those who **strive** and are **steadfast**. Those who hinder others from Allah's path and die as disbelievers are denied **forgiveness**."

    {
      "start_ayah": 35,
      "end_ayah": 38,
      "theme": "Ethics of Spending and Resolve",
      "summary": "Believers are exhorted not to waver or call for peace while they have the upper hand, as the worldly life is merely **play and pastime**. While Allah is **Rich** and does not need human possessions, He calls the faithful to spend in His cause, warning that **stinginess** is a harm to one's own soul."
