      "theme": "Divine Omniscience and the Hour",
      "summary": "Allah is praised as the absolute owner of the heavens and the earth, possessing complete knowledge of all that enters, emerges, descends, or ascends. He affirms the certainty of the **Hour** and the **Day of Account**, where every atom's weight of conduct is recorded to ensure a just recompense for believers and a painful penalty for those who undermine His revelations."

      "start_ayah": 7,
      "end_ayah": 9,
      "theme": "Skepticism of the Resurrection",
      "summary": "The text addresses the mockery of disbelievers regarding the **new creation** and the resurrection of the body after death. Allah points to the visible signs of the sky and the earth as a warning that His power can cause the earth to cave in or the sky to fall upon those who remain heedless."

      "theme": "Favors upon David and Solomon",
      "summary": "David is granted the miracle of echoing mountains and softened iron, while Solomon is gifted control over the wind and a spring of tar. Both are commanded to work with **appreciation**, illustrating that even the most powerful prophets are servants of Allah, while the death of Solomon exposes that the jinn have no knowledge of the **unseen**."

      "end_ayah": 21,
      "theme": "The Lesson of Sheba",
      "summary": "The people of Sheba were granted two flourishing gardens but faced destruction through a flood and bitter fruits as a penalty for their **ingratitude**. This narrative serves as a lesson for the steadfast, confirming that **Satan** has no authority except to distinguish those who truly believe in the Hereafter from those in doubt [525–526]."

    {
      "start_ayah": 22,
      "end_ayah": 30,
      "theme": "Futility of Shirk and Judgment",
      "summary": "Allah challenges those who invoke partners besides Him, asserting that these entities possess nothing in the heavens or earth and offer no **intercession** without His leave. The Prophet is identified as a universal warner, and the text emphasizes that the **appointed Day** is a fixed reality that cannot be advanced or delayed [526–527]."
    },
    {
      "start_ayah": 31,
      "end_ayah": 39,
      "theme": "The Trial of Wealth and Arrogance",
      "summary": "On the Day of Judgment, the oppressed will blame the arrogant elite for misleading them, but all will face the **retribution** of their deeds. The text clarifies that material **wealth and children** do not provide nearness to Allah; rather, only **faith and good deeds** grant the high chambers of Paradise, as Allah expands or restricts provisions according to His will [527–528]."

    {
      "start_ayah": 40,
      "end_ayah": 45,
      "theme": "Disavowal of False Deities",
      "summary": "In the final reckoning, the angels will disavow those who worshiped them, stating that the idolaters were actually following the **jinn**. The surah critiques those who reject the Truth as magic or lies, reminding them that more powerful previous nations were destroyed for their **rejection** of the messengers."
    },
    {
      "start_ayah": 46,
      "end_ayah": 54,
      "theme": "Final Proclamation and the Barrier",
      "summary": "Humanity is urged to reflect individually or in pairs on the truth of the Message, acknowledging Allah as the Knower of the **Unseen**. The surah concludes with the image of disbelievers seized by terror when it is too late to believe, as a **barrier** is permanently placed between them and the desires they pursued in the worldly life [528–529]."
