*   Verses 1–5 (Signs in the Universe): Allah identifies natural phenomena—including the creation of humans, the movement of creatures, the alternation of night and day, and the **sustenance** sent from the sky—as proofs for those who believe and reason. These signs serve to establish the **truth** of the revelation sent from the Almighty and Wise.

*   Verses 6–11 (Consequences of Rejecting Revelation): A warning is issued to every "sinful liar" who hears divine verses but persists in **arrogance** and mockery. Their worldly acquisitions and false lords will not benefit them against the **agonizing pain** and shameful punishment of Hell.

*   Verses 12–15 (Divine Favors and Accountability): Allah has subjected the **sea** and the contents of the heavens and earth to human service as a bounty from Himself [406–407]. The principle of **individual accountability** is established, stating that righteous deeds benefit the soul while evil conduct is to its own detriment.

*   Verses 16–17 (History of the Israelites): The text recounts the favors bestowed upon the Children of Israel, including the **Book, wisdom, and prophecy**, and their subsequent fall into dispute due to **mutual rivalry**. Allah affirms that He will judge between them regarding these religious differences on the Day of Resurrection.

*   Verses 18–20 (The Pathway of Faith): The Prophet is set upon a clear **pathway of faith (Shariah)** and commanded not to follow the inclinations of those who do not know. This revelation serves as an **illumination** and mercy for those who believe with certainty, identifying Allah as the Protector of the righteous.

*   Verses 21–22 (Divine Justice in Creation): The text refutes the idea that the wicked and the righteous are equal in life or death, calling such an assumption **evil judgment**. Allah created the heavens and earth with **justice** to ensure every soul is repaid exactly for what it has earned.

*   Verses 23–26 (Denial of the Resurrection): Those who take their **desires as their god** are described as having sealed hearts and veiled vision, leading them to claim that only **time** destroys humanity. Allah asserts His role as the giver of life and death, confirming the certainty of the **Day of Resurrection** despite the skepticism of the faithless [407–408].

*   Verses 27–35 (The Gathering and Judgment): On the Day the Hour occurs, every community will be summoned to its **Book (Record)** to be repaid for their deeds. While believers enter divine **mercy**, the arrogant will be forgotten in the Fire because they took Allah’s revelations for a **joke** and were lured by the worldly life.

*   Verses 36–37 (Divine Supremacy and Praise): The surah concludes by ascribing all praise to Allah as the Lord of the heavens, earth, and **humanity**. It affirms that absolute **supremacy** and majesty in the universe belong to Him, the Majestic and the Wise.
