*   Verses 1–6 (Purpose of Creation and Futility of Shirk): Allah created the heavens and the earth with **reason** and for a finite period, yet disbelievers ignore the warnings they receive. Those who invoke partners besides Allah are challenged to produce evidence of their creation or a trace of previous **scripture** to justify their actions. On the Day of Resurrection, these false deities will become enemies to their worshipers and renounce their service.

*   Verses 7–12 (Authenticity and Confirmation of Revelation): Disbelievers dismiss the truth as magic or invention, while the Prophet identifies himself as a mortal **warner** who follows only what is inspired. The Quran serves as a confirming Book in Arabic, following the model of the **Book of Moses**, to warn wrongdoers and provide glad tidings. Evidence from witnesses among the Children of Israel validates the message, which detractors reject as an **ancient lie**.

*   Verses 13–16 (The Righteous and Filial Piety): Those who declare Allah as their Lord and act with **integrity** are promised Paradise as a reward for their conduct. Humanity is enjoined to show kindness to parents, acknowledging the thirty-month period of **bearing and weaning**. The text highlights the prayer of the mature believer who seeks to appreciate divine blessings and petitions for **righteous offspring**.

*   Verses 17–20 (Rejection of Resurrection and Accountability): In contrast to the righteous, the ungrateful child mocks the **resurrection** as mere tales of the ancients. All individuals are assigned degrees according to their works, ensuring that every soul is repaid in full during the final **reckoning**. On the Day of Judgment, the faithless will be rebuked for squandering their goods in the **worldly life** and for their unjust arrogance.

*   Verses 21–28 (Narrative of Aad and the Dunes): The narrative of the brother of Aad (Hud) illustrates a warning delivered at the **dunes**, which his people rejected out of ignorance. They mistook a cloud of **divine punishment** for rain, resulting in a wind that destroyed everything except their dwellings. This historical precedent demonstrates that physical senses and material empowerment do not avail those who disregard the **revelations** of Allah.

*   Verses 29–32 (Group of Jinn and Their Witness): A group of **jinn** listened to the Quran and recognized it as a scripture confirming what was sent down after Moses. They returned to their people as warners, urging them to answer the **caller to Allah** to find forgiveness and safety from painful punishment. The text affirms that those who do not answer the divine call are in **manifest error** and possess no protectors.

*   Verses 33–35 (Divine Omnipotence and Prophetic Resolve): Allah’s creation of the heavens and earth without fatigue is cited as proof of His power to **revive the dead**. Disbelievers will be forced to acknowledge the truth of the message when they are presented to the **Fire**. The surah concludes with a command for the Prophet to maintain **patience** like the messengers of resolve, noting that the span of human life will seem like only an hour during the final meeting.
